# Calcify

##  Project Description
This project targets industrial air pollution from the **Suez Cement Factory in Katameya**, one of Egypt’s largest cement producers. It provides a **sustainable and low-cost air purification system** that neutralizes harmful gases like **CO₂** and **SOx** using **recycled eggshells**.

Eggshells from nearby bakeries are chemically converted into **calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)₂)** and placed into the system to neutralize acidic gases, producing harmless **CaCO₃ and CaSO₄** byproducts.

##  How It Works

### 1. **Pre-Filtration Layer**
- Reusable mask filters block large dust particles and debris.

### 2. **Neutralization Chamber**
- A fiber-sandwiched layer of Ca(OH)₂ reacts with acidic gases from the chimney exhaust.

### 3. **Airflow System**
- Controlled by **electric blowers**, **MQ-135 gas sensors**, and **electronic gas valves**. The flow is regulated through a Raspberry Pi 3B.

### 4. **Sustainability**
- Eggshell waste is repurposed using a chemical conversion process with **HCl**, reducing waste while producing effective neutralizers.
